I think they mean 1.6 metres which is about 5 foot and 4 inches? Japan actually warned citizens about it being possibly 3 metres which is 9 feet 8 inches on their live NHK news station this morning. And tsunamis are not usual “waves.” It is water displacement - water comes inland. For example- you only need 30cm of water to push a small car away which is only 11.7 inches. Tsunamis are not to be messed with or underestimated.,negative,or2bVDokuiQ
